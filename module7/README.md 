# Simple Task Tracker

## Inspiration
I wanted a basic, easy-to-use application that could help keep track of daily tasks.

## Vision
The vision for this project is to create a  task management tool where users can:
- Add new tasks with a due date and priority
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks when done
- View tasks in an organized, simple list

## Basic Functionality
- **Add Task**: Add a task with a name, due date, and priority level (Low, Medium, High).
- **Delete Task**: Remove selected tasks from the list.
- **Mark Complete**: Mark a selected task as completed.
- **Separate Windows**: The "Add Task" feature opens in a new window, separate from the main window.
- **Styled UI**: Custom styles applied via CSS.

## How to Use
1. Launch the application.
2. To add a new task:
   - Click on **File â†’ New Task** from the menu bar.
   - Fill out the task name, select a due date, and choose a priority.
   - Click **Save** to add the task.
3. To mark a task as complete:
   - Select a task from the list.
   - Click **"Mark Complete"** at the bottom.
4. To delete a task:
   - Select a task and click **"Delete Task"**.

## Completed Functionality
- Main window with task list and controls
- Add Task separate window
- Menu with keyboard shortcuts
- Full styling with CSS
- Dynamic resizing of Add Task window based on parent window

## Features Still Under Construction
- Saving tasks between runs (currently, tasks reset on restart)
