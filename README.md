# Software Construction Course - Project Overview

This repository contains coursework and projects developed during my Software Construction class at Auburn University. Each module focuses on different aspects of building reliable, maintainable, and scalable software using Java and JavaFX. Below is a summary of each module and the skills applied.

## Module 1: Java Basics Refresher
- Focused on class structures, encapsulation, and basic I/O.
- Developed a simple console-based Java application to reinforce core object-oriented programming principles.

## Module 2: Seat Reservation System
- Built a basic reservation system using object-oriented principles.
- Implemented classes to model seats, users, and reservations.
- Introduced to unit testing using JUnit to verify logic.

## Module 3: Airport Data Viewer
- Created a GUI-based application with JavaFX.
- Learned how to parse and display airport data using TableView.
- Integrated external APIs (e.g., Windy.com in WebView) to show weather info based on airport codes.

## Module 4: Flight Scheduling Application
- Developed a more complex JavaFX application for managing flight schedules.
- Focused on MVC architecture and persistent data storage using text files.
- Implemented features like add/edit/delete flights and days-of-week selection using UI controls.

## Module 5: Styling and Theming with CSS
- Applied custom stylesheets (`main.css`) to JavaFX components.
- Used fonts and images to theme a launcher application with a grid of buttons.
- Emphasized separation of concerns between logic and presentation.

## Module 6: UI Models and Bindings
- Learned about property bindings and observable lists.
- Connected a UI model to UI components for real-time validation and feedback.
- Created responsive forms with dynamic state (e.g., enabling/disabling buttons).

## Module 7: Task Management App (Capstone)
- Combined all prior concepts into a mini productivity app.
- Used modular design, JavaFX scene switching, input validation, and polished styling.
- Demonstrated version control proficiency using Git and GitHub.
